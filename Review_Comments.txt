Moved the driver to a separate folder (libs).
Added a testNG file to run the tests.
Moved all the three class files to testcases package in src/main/java.
Converted the project to TestNG.


Maximized the Window.
WebDriver driver=new ChromeDriver(); We can't instantiate driver outside a method. Fixed it.
Instead of Thread.sleep(), we can give implicit wait of 2 seconds.
The signInButton was present in a frame. We've to switch to that frame and then click on the button.
My chrome browser wasn't compatible with the provided chromedriver version. So, updated it to the one present in my local system.


In HotelBookingTest class, we're using the Page Factory Model, but we didn't initialized the web elements after opening the web page. Did that using PageFactory.initElement(driver, this);
Was unable to click on the search button, so clicked it using JavaScriptExecutor.


Destination id should be "ToTag".
Was not able to click on the calendar to select the date, now selecting date in next month.

Did changes in the testng.xml file so that the 3 tests run simultaneously. This will reduce the execution time to run the suite.
